These are modified components that work with Adapt 5.

They are original created by Aaron:

https://github.com/CollierCZ/adapt-narrativeCode
https://github.com/CollierCZ/adapt-textWithCode
https://github.com/CollierCZ/adapt-cmcq

And they would need to be updated + published on adapt - https://www.adaptlearning.org/index.php/plugin-browser/ to be installable via Adapt CLI
